# GAME DESCRIPTION
This is Handymath, a simple but fun game involving *hands* and *math*!
We created this game for users of all ages, especially young children who are new to the world of math. 
Users can excel in this game by reacting quickly to newly generated math problems. We hope to provide an interactive learning experience from which children can hone their arithmetic skills as well as improve their hand mobility.

### How the game works
Simple math problems of addition, subtraction and multiplication are randomly generated.
The user can solve the problems by holding up hand gestures of numbers 1-9, one digit at a time.
