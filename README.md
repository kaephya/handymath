# GAME DESCRIPTION
This is Handymath, a simple but fun game involving *hands* and *math*!
This game is suitable for users of all ages, especially young children who are new to the world of math. 
In order to excel in this game, users need to react to newly generated math problems by performing quick mental math.
We aim to provide an interactive learning experience from which children can hone their arithmetic skills. Playing this game regularly can yield positive results in
developing the children's brains and stimulating neural pathways from an early age. We hope that children can not only have fun, but also discover their interest in math through this game.


### How the game works
- Simple math problems of addition, subtraction and multiplication are randomly generated.
- The user can solve the problems by holding up hand gestures of numbers 1-9, one digit at a time.

### How we created this
- Take 100-150 photos of hand gestures 1-9, at different angles.
- Train the AI model
